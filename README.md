# Zenith Launcher

A private, offline Android home screen. Part of the Zenith's Space app collection.
Application ID `app.zenith.launcher`.

## Features

- Home screen over your wallpaper with the time and date. The clock updates on Android's minute
  tick while the home screen is showing; the launcher runs no timer of its own.
- Swipe up anywhere for the app drawer: every app with a launcher icon, alphabetical, work-profile
  apps included (with their badge).
- Search at the top of the drawer. Matches the start of the name first, then the start of a word,
  then anywhere; case and accents are ignored. The keyboard's Go key opens the best match.
- Tap to open (the app's window grows from its icon); long-press for App info.
- Back, home or pulling down from the top of the list closes the drawer.
- The list updates when apps are installed, removed or changed, from Android's package events,
  never by polling.
- Settings: long-press the home screen (or the gear in the drawer). Shows whether this is your
  home app, with a shortcut to change it; wallpaper; clock and swipe hint on or off; app names
  under icons; pure black in dark mode.
- Wallpaper: long-press the home screen > Wallpaper. Pick a photo with Android's photo picker,
  then crop and set it with the system's wallpaper screen. No storage permission.

## Try it and make it your home app

The launcher also has an ordinary app icon, so you can try it without changing anything:
open **Zenith Launcher** from your current launcher.

To use it as the home screen, tap the card at the top of its settings, or go to Settings > Apps > Default apps > Home app (Samsung: Settings >
Apps > Choose default apps > Home app) and pick Zenith Launcher. To go back, pick your previous
home app (for example One UI Home) in the same place. Your old launcher stays installed.

## Build

Requirements: JDK 17 and the Android SDK with platform 37.

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug          # app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # unit tests
./gradlew lintDebug              # Android Lint
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Debug builds use the application ID `app.zenith.launcher.dev` and show as "Zenith Launcher Dev",
so they install beside the release without a signature clash.

### Signed release build

Put a `keystore.properties` file (storeFile, storePassword, keyAlias, keyPassword) outside the
repository and point the Gradle property `zenithLauncherSigning` at it, for example in
`~/.gradle/gradle.properties`. Without it, release builds are left unsigned.
